# rlmolecule

## About

A library for general-purpose material and molecular optimization using AlphaZero-style reinforcement learning.

Code currently under development as part of
the ["End-to-End Optimization for Battery Materials and Molecules by Combining Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning"](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects/end-end-optimization-battery-materials-and-molecules-combining-graph-neural)
project at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Colorado School of Mines (CSU), and Colorado State
University (CSU). Funding provided by the Advanced Research Projects Agencyâ€“Energy (ARPA-E)'
s [DIFFERENTIATE program](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/programs/differentiate)

## Installation

Most dependencies for this project are installable via conda, with the exception of [nfp](https://github.com/NREL/nfp),
which can be installed via pip. An example conda environment file is provided below:

## Usage

This library is still under active development, and APIs are expected to change frequently. Currently, optimization
proceeds by subclassing `alphazero.Node` to provide the expected reward function calculation. Example usage of the
module is demonstrated for radical construction in `stable_radical_optimization/`.
