# Tensorflow-serving example code

An example of using tensorflow-serving to give model predictions for GNNs building nfp custom layers. This is looking
pretty promising if we can get a GPU-enabled singularity image to work on Eagle. Specifically, this might be a good way
to leverage heterogenous compute (GPUs and CPUs) by keeping the tensorflow models on GPU nodes (as served models) while
running rollouts on CPUs.
